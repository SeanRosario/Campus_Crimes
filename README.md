# Campus_Crimes

Project Description:
In this project, we want to work on a campus safety data which is obtained through the Campus Safety and Security survey! The Campus Safety and Security Survey, 2013 (CSSS 2013) is a data collection that is part of the Campus Safety and Security Survey (CSSS) program; program data is available since 2005 at http://ope.ed.gov/security/GetDownloadFile.aspx.

We will be working with CSSS 2013 data. CSSS 2013 (http://ope.ed.gov/security/) was a cross-sectional survey that collected information required for benefits about crime, criminal activity, and fire safety at postsecondary institutions in the United States.
 
We want to develop an application which gives different statistics about an institution and also provides comparative statistics about different universities in this context.

The user interacts with the program using an interface to choose universities. This involves developing a GUI using Python. To prepare the data available for processing, we need Pandas. To provide aggregated results from the data available, we need to use NumPy. Finally, to produce good visualizations about different characteristics about a university, we will use Matplotlib. 
 
 

Dataset:
The data set is used from the link below. It has data about on-campus arrests, on-campus crime, on-campus hate, public property discipline, non-campus arrests, non-campus crime pertaining to different educational institutes in the USA.
